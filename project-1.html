            <h1>Assignment & Process</h1>
            <p><span>The "Claim the City" assignment is an individual project that aims to explore innovative ways to address urban challenges and design solutions that positively impact the lives of city dwellers. Through this assignment, I was encouraged to think critically, research, and develop creative ideas that can help claim the city and make it a more livable, vibrant, and enjoyable place to be.</span><br>
              <span>In the beginning I came up with three different ideas. The chosen idea is "Listen to The City," a digital product that incorporates irritating temporary fences and city repair works into the everyday life of city dwellers in a positive way. The product addresses the design challenge by giving people a reason to experience city repair works and temporary fences in a different and positive way, encouraging communication between citizens within the urban environment, and engaging digital design with reality.</span><br>
              <span>The app allows citizens to interact with the environment by searching for and scanning a real-life QR-code. This encourages people to view renovation works and temporary fences as a destination rather than a reason to choose an alternative route. Through the app, citizens can leave a digital message to share their experience and thoughts with others, building new relationships with urban settings in a positive way.</span><br>

            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>The design is limited in functions but meaningful for city dwellers. People in big cities do not have time to chat, but they can share a song that speaks for them. The app also makes renovation works amusing and brings people together on the go. Overall, "Listen to The City" is a meaningful and relevant solution to the design challenge that may change people's perception of renovation works and create a positive experience for citizens in the city.
