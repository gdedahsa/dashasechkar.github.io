    <h1>Assignment & Process</h1>
          <p><span>I have been working on selecting a subculture to explore and observe for my research project. In the beginning, I considered three different subcultures, including dog owners, street artists, and coffee enthusiasts. Ultimately, I decided to focus on coffee enthusiasts because of my personal interest in coffee culture and the accessibility of this subculture.</span><br>
            <span>Before diving into the observation phase, I did some desk research to gather information on the coffee enthusiast subculture. From my research, I found that coffee is not just a drink, but also a passion and a ritual for these individuals. Coffeehouses serve as important social spaces for coffee lovers to connect with like-minded people and engage in leisure activities.</span><br>
            <span>Based on my desk research, I developed a list of curiosities to guide my observation phase. These questions include topics such as the factors that influence individuals to start drinking coffee, the preferred methods for brewing coffee, and the role of interior design in the coffee enthusiast subculture.

    <h1>Results</h1>
          <p>In summary, the final design direction is focused on emphasizing the social, meaningful, and educative aspects of coffee culture based on the user insights that coffee is a social clay, meaningful for coffee aficionados, and boosts self-confidence. The design should encourage coffee lovers to gain new knowledge and communicate with each other in a secure, pleasant, and casual manner. It should also combine meaningful and symbolic aspects to provide a unique and personal experience for coffee aficionados based on their general characteristics, hobbies, or current trends. The proposed design will broaden horizons and provide a sense of relatedness, allowing the subculture to focus on communicating with each other, which is particularly important in the 21st century.
